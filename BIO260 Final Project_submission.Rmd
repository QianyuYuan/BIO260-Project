## R Markdown

This will detail your steps in developing your solution, including how you collected the data, alternative solutions you tried, describing statistical methods you used, and the insights you got. Equally important to your final results is how you got there! Your RMarkdown and HTML files are the place you describe and document the space of possibilities you explored at each step of your project. We strongly advise you to include many visualizations.


### Overview and Motivation

### Initial Questions

### Data

### Exploratory Analysis
What visualizations did you use to look at your data in different ways? What are the different statistical methods you considered? Justify the decisions you made, and show any major changes to your ideas. How did you reach these conclusions?

### Final Analysis
